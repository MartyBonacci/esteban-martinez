				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				<p>As a new web developer and designer, it is very important that I establish myself as a professional in the development world. The purpose of building and maintaining a personal Web Portfolio is to demonstrate to potential clients the quality and range of my work. It is the visual representation of my work history, and also a chance to communicate quickly who I am as a developer.</p>

				<h3>Audience</h3>
				<p>What is an artist without someone to appreciate their work? I intend to build this portfolio for a range of professionals in this field, but mainly with potential clients in mind. My audience will include those who need work done, like-minded people with connections and networks in this industry and those who are looking for talent.</p>
